| -------- | --------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| ft_isalpha | int ft_isalpha(int c) | int: 1 if true, 0 if false | Checks if a character is a letter in the English alphabet (either upper and lower case). |
| ft_isdigit | int ft_isdigit(int c) | same as above | Checks if a character is a digit (0-9). |
| ft_isalnum | int ft_isalnum(int c) | same as above | Checks if a character is either a digit or a letter in the English alphabet. (Equivalent to ft_isalpha \|\| ft_isdigit). |
| ft_isascii | int ft_isascii(int c) | same as above | Checks if a character is a valid ASCII character (0-127 decimal). |
| ft_isprint | int ft_isprint(int c) | same as above | Checks if a character is a printable ASCII character (32-126 decimal). |
| ft_toupper | int ft_toupper(int c) | int | Converts a letter in the English alphabet to uppercase. |
| ft_tolower | int ft_tolower(int c) | int | converts  a letter in the English alphabet to lowercase. |
| ft_atoi | int ft_atoi(char *nptr) | int | Converts the first section of a string into int. Skips the leading white spaces as defined by isspace. Reads exactly one sign character. Stops at the first non-digit character afterwards.|
